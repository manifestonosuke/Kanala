# Purpose

This deck is designed to practice writing Joyo Kanji by using two kanji per card, allowing for all kanji to be covered in a minimal number of entries. It includes all 2,136 Joyo Kanji (plus a few non-Joyo) in 1,216 cards. Most kanji appear only once, but a few are on more than one card. There are very few exceptions with only one kanji per card, typically when the kanji lacks common jukugo (compound words), cannot be combined easily, or when the combinations are to rare to be mentioned.

In short, this deck covers all Joyo Kanji in 1,216 cards, primarily for writing practice, but it also provides a detailed breakdown of key elements and common words for each kanji. The deck uses only Japanese. It can be used to remind new words, readings thought vocabulary and study the kanji structure.

It is for people knowing more or less all Joyos and write order (not included in the cards)

# Card Structure

Card features a two-kanji word on the front. The answer is the word in kanji. The back also contains details about the kanji’s structure (radicals and components) as well as a list of words that include both on and kun readings. Only Joyo readings are covered, with a few exceptions noted in square brackets 「外　。。。」. The front entry usually features an On reading (but not always) and a hint phrase (in parentheses) is also provided to clarify which word is being referenced when not obvious (since there are many homophones in hiragana).

In some cases, the front entry may include more than two kanji. Usually only the first two kanji are meant to be guessed. If it is not the case the kanjis not being in the answer are in parenthesis.

## Explanations

### Front

Shows a word or jukugo, some time with a hint in parenthesis

> こうちょう　（顔に血が上って赤みを帯びること）

### Back

For each kanji there are 2 lines (kanji 1 壱 and kanji 2 弐).

- The kanji itself with in parenthesis bushu and then some kanji compond to help remember/write kanji separated with a pipe (|) some time there are 2 pipe, the latest being with compond without specific meaning but to help decompose the kanji. The main difference is that the compond can help to remember the reading as the compound without meaning are just stroke.

>   紅 （糸｜工）

Above kanji has 糸 bushu and contains also 工. For this one the ON reading is こう which is a reading of 工. Then the bushu is 糸 which means a string.

- The second line for each kanji give example words for all joyo reading (exception would be in parenthesis with starting with 外).  The order is ON and then KUN reading. 

   For ON reading if the reading is different from the search one, the reading will be written in parenthesis. For KUN reading the reading will be first and the kanji will be in paranthesis.

> 紅葉　紅茶　深紅（しんくう）　べに（紅）口紅　くれない（紅）

The 2 first word reading for 紅 is こう so the additional words have no reading (it reads **こう**よう and **こう**ちゃ)　and let you try reading others kanjis. Then comes 深紅 with hiragana reading in parenthesis , it means it is additional ON reading (くう).  The next word is in hiragana followed by kanji in parenthesis which means it's a KUN reading. 口紅 which reads くちべに is one example. くちべに being an easy reading and matching previous KUN yomi, the reading is not included. The last word is another KUN reading.

About the compound, above sample is very simple but for other kanji the original compound has changed or is difficult to remember. In this case I add hints to write it after the second |. 

### Kanji description 

In most of the cases in the parenthesis after kanji there is ( bushu | other part ). For the other part I tried to keep other kanji to describe the kanji. In above sample 潮 is 水 and 朝. It could be further decomposed in 氵龺月 or 氵十日十月 but it is simple enough to recognise and remember the compounds. 

> 敷 （攵｜旉|｜一由丶方）

The ethymology of 敷く is indeed 攵 (ぼくつくり）+ 旉 which is not used any more and has been slighty simplified where one would write in order 一 then 由 and finally 丶 plus 方 below. This part being only hint to write is in 2nd place after a second |. 旉 being the really non bushu part is just after the bush with a single |.



# Usage

Take you favourite pen and paper and browse the deck, write down the kanji verify the answer.

If you don't know/remind, give a close look to the kanji bushu and compounds, try to make you own story to remind it better. For example the kanji 美 has 2 compounds 羊｜大 which means respective sheep and big (which is actually the real etymology) ... You can make your own story there !  Then write down the word a few time, additionally write other word containing the kanji you do not know.

If you do remind the front word make sure you remember all readings, have a look to other words, you'll perhaps learn new vocabulary. 

# Side notes

## Vocabulary

 I tried to use the most common readings, sometime it is not really possible because it is rare or have no other reading. For some words I use non joyo kanjis to make the front entry if those word are common enough (like 漏洩, 洩 being non joyo).

## Non joyo

To try to limit kanji repetition in front field and also because some common words are sometime build with non joyo kanji, I use add the following like of kanjis which are not joyo.

> 怯萌塵絆拗苑蒙晦蘭煉耽洩

As there is no joyo reading there are a few sample words which should be the common one. It may not cover all the readings.

## Kanji compounds and bushu

The bushu should all be correct but some kanji have more than one. For this one I verify on different ressources and if all of them show multiples entries I decide to keep the one that makes more sense (to me ...)

## Strike order

Strikes counts/order and other other code numbers are not included. you need to know the logic of stroke order and if you have any doubt check any strike order site. This is quite easy to find kanji strike order guide on the internet (see Ressources) 

To understand the rules [wikipedia](<https://ja.wikipedia.org/wiki/%E7%AD%86%E9%A0%86) is probably the easiest, the [english page](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Stroke_order) covers chinese writing which differs a bit.


## Katsuji/tegaki

Katsuji (活字) is how are called the kanji shape when printed (originally now for computer fonts as well). Sometime it is different from the hand written one. I tried to keep the handwritten on on the cards and add the katsuji in the vocabulary comments.

The kanjis which shows difference writing between hand written and printed (font) are :

> 剥𠮟填挟頰

I will add the terrific 虞 which shows different shape with the same unicode ... I did not really find the good way to show the different writings. The orginal kanji should have  虍＋呉 (which could help for the "non joyo" reading) but is usually shown as 吴.

# Why joyo

Kanji system is very old and there are too many readings to remind, although joyo are not always really common and some common kanji are not joyo, it is more than enough to exercise your Japanese writing ability. Even if some joyo are practically never used (朕since WW2), it is still a good reference. Note that the latest update of the joyo kanjis (2010) contains ken (県) names, which may only be used for this reading.

Even joyo kanjis have non joyo readings, which are usually listed in base kanji deck and are probably not worth to remember. I used only joyo reading or explain in the card. I did not especially cover the **special readings** of the joyo kanjis (in the 付表 list or joyo)

My main (but not unique) source for word frequency is [NINJAL or 言語資源開発センター](https://clrd.ninjal.ac.jp/bccwj/en/freq-list.html). </br>
I love https://kanjiapi.dev/ which provide an API to query basic kanji properties. </br>
Most of the kanji compound comes from the (wonderful) site [jitenon](https://kanji.jitenon.jp/), there is also strike order and all different readings (joyo/non joyo).  </br>

The 3rd section (3 付表) which list specific reading of kanjis is not really covered in this deck (like 明日　あす). </br>
Bunka.org also contains a [kanji frequency table](https://www.bunka.go.jp/seisaku/bunkashingikai/kokugo/nihongo/nihongo_107/pdf/93240301_06.pdf) </br>

# Dictionary
For kanji ethymology, I used the wonderful dictionnary of 常用字解［第二版］from 白川静. 
For the bushu I enjoy lookup in 部首ときあかし辞典 from 円満字二郎. 

# Issues
I copy and paste various ressources and may have left html code in deck fields. I didn't sanitise all entries and some reading maybe not visible if you use a dark skin for Anki.

The deck is build manually over months and early cards syntax may differ from the latest
